Occasionally you might want to reset a particular student's quiz attempt (for example, to allow them to re-attempt the quiz), or you might want to reset all attempts. Resetting deletes attempts and allows students to try again.

1. On your course page, locate the quiz and click the **Quiz name** to open the quiz activity
2. On the _Quiz summary_ page, select **Attempts: #**
	- The _Attempts summary_ page will open.
3. Select the check boxes next to the student(s) whose attempts you want to delete.
4. Click **Delete selected attempts**.
